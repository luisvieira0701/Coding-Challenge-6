# Coding-Challenge-6
Created a simple employee shift management system for a small business. The system will track employee schedules, check availability, assign shifts, and calculate total hours worked for each employee. Used objects to represent employees and shifts, arrays to store schedules, and array/object methods for data manipulation.
